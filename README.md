# HorizontalHazzards
Horizontal Hazzards is a side-scrolling space shooter game. The player maneuvers a spaceship while waves of enemies spawn and try to destroy it. This is still very much so a work in progress.<br>

# Design and Features
This project was written in Python 3 and uses the pygame library to handle graphics. Graphics are at a basic stage, and were drawn in Adobe Illustrator. Multiple types of enemies spawn, and follow set waypoints while shooting at the player. Shots are directed to were the player's ship is. An expierence system is in place to earn XP from each kill that automatically levels up the player and increases stats.<br>
